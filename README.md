## 📝 Overview
**Matrix-Game-3.0** is an open-sourced, memory-augmented interactive world model designed for 720p real-time long-form video generation.
- **Upgraded Data Engine**: Combines Unreal Engine-based synthetic data, large-scale automated AAA game data, and real-world video augmentation to generate high-quality Video–Pose–Action–Prompt data. 
- **Long-horizon Memory & Consistency**: Uses prediction residuals and frame re-injection for self-correction, while camera-aware memory ensures long-term spatiotemporal consistency. 
- **Real-Time Interactivity & Open Access**: It employs a multi-segment autoregressive distillation strategy based on Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), combined with model quantization and VAE decoder distillation to support [40fps] real-time generation at 720p resolution with a 5B model, while maintaining stable memory consistency over minute-long sequence.
- **Scale Up 28B-MoE Model**: Scaling up to a 2×14B model further improves generation quality, dynamics, and generalization. 

## 🤗 Matrix-Game-3.0 Model
We provide two pretrained 5B model weights, including the base model and the distilled model, for first-person generation in unreal scenes. These resources are available on our HuggingFace page. 

In addition, the model trained on a combination of unreal and real-world data, as well as the 28B large model, will be released soon! 🚀🚀

## Requirements
It supports one gpu or multi-gpu inference. We tested this repo on the following setup:
* A/H series GPUs are tested.
* Linux operating system.
* 64 GB RAM.

## ⚙️ Quick Start
### Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```
conda create -n matrix-game-3.0 python=3.12 -y
conda activate matrix-game-3.0
# install FlashAttention
# Our project also depends on [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game-3.0.git
cd Matrix-Game-3.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Download
```
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download Matrix-Game-3.0 --local-dir Matrix-Game-3.0
```
### Inference
Before running inference, you need to prepare:
- Input image
- Text prompt

After downloading pretrained models, you can use the following command to generate an interactive video with random actions:
``` sh
torchrun --nproc_per_node=$NUM_GPUS generate.py --size 704*1280 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ckpt_dir Matrix-Game-3.0 --fa_version 3 --use_int8 --num_iterations 12 --num_inference_steps 3 --image demo_images/001/image.png --prompt "A colorful, animated cityscape with a gas station and various buildings." --save_name test --seed 42 --compile_vae --lightvae_pruning_rate 0.5 --vae_type mg_lightvae --output_dir ./output
# "num_iterations" refers to the number of iterations you want to generate. The total number of frames generated is given by:57 + (num_iterations - 1) * 40 
```
Tips: 
If you want to use the base model, you can use `--use_base_model --num_inference_steps 50`. To run with your own input actions, use `--interactive`.
For LightVAE, use `--vae_type mg_lightvae` with `--lightvae_pruning_rate 0.5`, or `--vae_type mg_lightvae_v2` with `--lightvae_pruning_rate 0.75`. `mg_lightvae_v2` is faster than `mg_lightvae` while keeping quality close to the latter.
With multiple GPUs, you can pass `--use_async_vae --async_vae_warmup_iters 1` to speed up inference (see [`test.sh`](test.sh)).
